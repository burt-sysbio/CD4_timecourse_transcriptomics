Scanning and data analysis

Microarray scanning was done using an iScan array scanner. 
Data extraction was done for all beads individually, and 
outliers are removed when the absolute difference to the 
median is greater than 2.5 times MAD(2.5 Hampel’s method). 
All remaining bead level data points are than quantile 
normalized [1]. As test for significance the student’s t-test is 
used on the [After 14.02.2017: log2 scaled] bead expression values 
of the two groups of interest.
In the case of significance of expression against background we 
tested for greater than all negative beads for this sample and 
in the case of comparing separate groups we tested for inequality 
of the means of the groups.
[After 14.02.2017: In the case of comparing groups we additionally
calculate p-values using averaged expression values for each
sample in the group.]
For the differential expression analysis Benjamini-Hochberg 
correction [2] is applied to the complete set of p-values of 
all ProbeIDs on the chip. The average expression value is 
calculated as mean of the measured expressions of beads 
together with the standard deviation of the beads.

The analysis is done with R on the bead-level data which you
can find in the raw data produced by the scanner (e.g. in
5282035051.7z the file 5282035051_A.txt, which holds bead
level data for all probeIDs of sample A).

All analyses are done using the following mechanisms:
1) outlier removal (see below).
2) average values over beads are means (not median).
3) statistical tests are t-tests over all beads (e.g for one 
   probeID over all beads of all samples of a group) 
   [Before 14.02.2017: in original scale (not log2 scale).]
   [After 14.02.2017: in log2 scale.]
   
   Example:
    group x is sample A,B,C
    control y is sample D,E,F
    to test for significance of difference between group x 
    and control y, we use
    t.test(all_beads_of_A_B_C, all_beads_D_E_F, 
      alternative = "two.sided",
      mu = 0 )

   Example:
    to check for significance against background (one specific 
    probeID):
      t.test(all_beads_of_A, all_negative_of_A, alternative="greater")

   Benjamini-Hochberg correction is applied over all p-values of
   the differential expression analysis.
   
   [After 14.02.2017: Additionally p-values of group comparissons
   are calculated on the sample expression mean values:
   Example:
    group x is sample A,B,C
    control y is sample D,E,F
    to test for significance of difference between group x 
    and control y, we use
    t.test(mean_values_of_A_B_and_C, mean_values_of_D_E_and_F,
      alternative = "two.sided",
      mu = 0 )
   ]

   
Calculation of GeneView data:
The calculations are also done on the set of beads which belong to
a given Gene Symbol (annotation column Symbol).

   
Outlier removal on bead level:

Outliers are removed by taking only beads with an expression value > 20 before
using the 2.5 MADs rule. The ProbeIDs expression value is than the mean of the 
remaining beads.

The remaining bead level lists of different length for each sample are randomly
filled with NAs (NA=not available) and build the bead level matrix on which quantile
normalization is performed.

MAD rule:
mad = median absolute deviation
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_absolute_deviation>)
x = one bead level expression value of some specific probeID
Than:
outliers are those x where abs((x-median)/mad) > 2.5 


Note for Agilent expression and miRNA chips:

As scanner is used an Agilent SureScan Microarray Scanner.

The Agilent Feature Extraction Software is used to generate raw data files.

For further analysis all files having similar filenames to e.g.
US22502683_253118113330_S01_miRNA_107_Sep09_1_1.txt
are used where columns gMedianSignal and gBGMedianSignal(=background) are
used as raw input data.

Agilent chips do not consist of beads but similar to the Illumina design 
each oligo is multiple times (depending on the chip type) on the chip 
for each sample. This redundancy is used to do the same analysis on the 
Agilent chips as used with the Illumina Bead chips.
For Agilent chips where only one oligo is in place, column .nbeads will show
the value 1, standard deviation is NA (not available) and p-values against
background is set to 1.0.

For the Agilent miRNA chips, the GeneView data is calculated using the
mirBase ID of the miRNA (e.g. mmu-miR-669g).

Note for Affymetrix:

Analogous to the multiple beads the Affymetrix Probeset is used to average
multiple measurements for one gene. Only the perfect match probes are used.
The mismatch probes are discarded.
