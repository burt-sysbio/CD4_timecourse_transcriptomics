Summarisation of bead level data:

Outliers are removed by taking only beads with an expression value > 20 before
using the 2.5 MADs rule. The ProbeIDs expression value is than the mean of the 
remaining beads.

MAD rule:
mad = median absolute deviation
(<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_absolute_deviation>)
x = one bead level expression value of some specific probeID
Than:
outliers are those x where abs((x-median)/mad) > 2.5
